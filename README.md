Automatic Invoice Generator

This repository showcases an automatic invoice generator I built to solve a real-life problem for a family member.
The original version used real student data, but Iâ€™ve anonymized it to ensure privacy so it can be shared as a public code example.

What It Does

The tool automates the creation of invoice PDFs for each student in a provided list. For each recipient, it:
Fills in a pre-defined invoice form with personalized data.
Assigns a unique invoice number.
Saves the completed invoices as PDF files in the desired format.

This solution significantly improves efficiency compared to manual invoice generation in Excel, saving time and reducing the chance of human error.
